- Hi, I’m @devcil, a naive programmer from Istanbul.
- While I code for a living, I feel like I lost my curiosity in the tech world.
- I will try to rekindle my love for the computers by building some things in a rather *simple* way.
- I decided to share my code and thoughts in the hope that I encourage some other people to do the same.
